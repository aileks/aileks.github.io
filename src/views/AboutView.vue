          My name is Aaliyah. I'm a current ASU student pursuing a B.S. in
          Software Engineering with a passion for technology and the web as a
          platform. Ever since I was a kid I've been tinkering with gadgets and
          teaching myself things. My passion for tech drives me and I'm always
          looking to improve.
